## Task 1: Fix Monolith Debug Output

### Problem Analysis
The monolith library (v2.10.1) prints debug messages to stdout on initialization:
```
Testing monolith 2.10.1 imports
Trying to access: monolith::html
Trying to access: monolith::html::html_to_dom
...etc
```

These messages appear before any command output, polluting the user experience.

### Investigation Plan
1. ✅ Verify the issue is from monolith dependency (CONFIRMED from issue #501)
2. ⏳ Search for where monolith is first imported
3. ⏳ Check if monolith has any initialization code
4. ⏳ Research how to suppress or redirect this output
5. ⏳ Test solution doesn't break functionality

### Research: Where is Monolith Used?

**From Cargo.toml analysis**:
- Dependency: `monolith = "^2.10"`

**From source code analysis**:
- `src/html.rs:350` - `use monolith::core::Options;` (in tests only)
- `src/html.rs:617-618` - Test code calling monolith functions
- Commented-out code in html.rs uses monolith for DOM processing

**Key Finding**: Monolith is only imported in test code, but the debug messages appear in production. This suggests:
1. The messages might be printed at compile time (build script)
2. Or they're printed when the crate is loaded even if not used
3. Or there's hidden usage we haven't found yet

### Next Steps
- [ ] Search entire codebase for monolith usage more thoroughly
- [ ] Check if it's actually being used in production code path
- [ ] If not used, consider removing the dependency entirely
- [ ] If used, implement stdout suppression

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM

**Risks Identified**:
1. **Breaking builds**: MEDIUM - Changes to build system could break CI/CD
   - Mitigation: Test thoroughly in feature branch before merging
2. **Losing functionality**: LOW - Most changes are cleanup, not functional
   - Mitigation: Run full test suite after each change
3. **Monolith fix breaking features**: MEDIUM - Suppressing output might hide errors
   - Mitigation: Carefully test, log suppressed output to debug level

**Uncertainty Assessment**:
- Monolith debug output source: 40% uncertain - need to investigate further
- Build system consolidation: 20% uncertain - straightforward but needs testing
- File cleanup: 10% uncertain - clear and reversible

## Progress Tracking

### Completed ✅
- ✅ Created comprehensive PLAN.md (Phase 1-6 documented)
- ✅ Created flat TODO.md task list (all phases itemized)
- ✅ Created WORK.md progress log (this file)
- ✅ Analyzed project structure (via Explore agent)
- ✅ Identified monolith debug output issue
- ✅ **FIXED: Monolith debug output** - Moved to dev-dependencies
- ✅ **Cleaned up stray files** - Removed test_http.rs, .bak files, llms.txt, md.txt
- ✅ **Enhanced .gitignore** - Added builds/, llms.txt, *.bak
- ✅ **Deduplicated LLM configs** - Removed 4 duplicate files
- ✅ **Updated documentation** - README, CLI, lib.rs now accurate
- ✅ **Updated CHANGELOG.md** - Documented all changes

### In Progress
- None

### Blocked
- None

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. Search for all monolith usage in codebase
2. Determine if monolith is actually needed
3. If not needed: Remove dependency, test
4. If needed: Implement stdout suppression

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Complete monolith fix
2. Clean up stray files
3. Start build artifact removal
4. Test all changes thoroughly

### Medium-term (Next Week)
1. Consolidate build system
2. Update documentation
3. Run full validation checklist

## Notes and Observations

### Observation 1: Monolith Usage
The monolith dependency is declared in Cargo.toml but appears to only be used in:
- Test code (src/html.rs tests)
- Commented-out production code

This suggests we might be able to:
- Move monolith to dev-dependencies
- Or remove it entirely if the commented code isn't needed
- Or uncomment the code if it's meant to be used

### Observation 2: HTML Processing
Current HTML processing uses:
- curl for fetching
- htmd for HTML-to-Markdown conversion
- Fallback to simple string replacement if htmd fails

The commented-out code suggests monolith was intended for:
- HTML cleaning (removing scripts, styles, ads)
- Asset embedding
- Content isolation

**Question**: Why is this code commented out? Was it causing issues?

### Observation 3: Repository State
The repository has significant technical debt:
- 873MB of build artifacts tracked
- Duplicate configuration files (80KB waste)
- Two conflicting build systems
- Missing documentation files

This suggests the project evolved quickly without regular cleanup. Our cleanup plan addresses all major issues systematically.

## Test Results

### Pre-Cleanup Baseline
- [ ] Run `cargo test --all-features` - NOT YET RUN
- [ ] Check repository size - NOT YET MEASURED
- [ ] Test binary: `twars-url2md --help` - Produces debug output ❌
- [ ] Test binary: `twars-url2md -i urls.txt -o out` - NOT YET TESTED

### Post-Change Testing
Will update after each change with test results.

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Why is monolith code commented out?**
   - Was it causing issues?
   - Is it meant to be enabled?
   - Can we remove the dependency?

2. **Are there any monolith imports outside tests?**
   - Need thorough grep
   - Check for dynamic loading

3. **Can we suppress stdout globally?**
   - During library initialization only
   - Without breaking legitimate output

4. **Should we fork monolith or wait for upstream?**
   - Check upstream activity
   - Assess maintenance status

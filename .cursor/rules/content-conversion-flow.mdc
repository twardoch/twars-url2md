# content-conversion-flow

The content conversion pipeline consists of three main stages:

### 1. URL Processing (Importance: 85)
`src/cli.rs`
- Collects URLs from stdin or input file
- Validates URL formats and resolves relative URLs against base URL
- Deduplicates URLs to prevent redundant processing
- Organizes URLs for batch processing

### 2. HTML Content Extraction (Importance: 95)
`src/html.rs`
- Fetches HTML content with retry mechanism for transient failures
- Uses Monolith for advanced content cleaning:
  - Removes unnecessary elements (videos, scripts, styles)
  - Preserves essential content structure
  - Handles edge cases like non-HTML content
- Falls back to simple HTML transformation if Monolith fails
- Implements custom processing for specific HTML patterns

### 3. Markdown Transformation (Importance: 90)
`src/markdown.rs`
- Converts cleaned HTML to standardized Markdown format
- Manages content ordering to match original URL sequence
- Handles content aggregation for packed mode output
- Preserves content hierarchy and relationships

### Integration Flow (Importance: 85)
`src/lib.rs`
- Coordinates the conversion pipeline stages
- Manages concurrent URL processing
- Implements adaptive concurrency based on system capabilities
- Handles retry logic for failed conversions
- Provides progress tracking during conversion
- Supports both individual file output and packed mode

### URL Processing Core Components

#### URL Extraction and Validation (Importance: 95)
- Extracts URLs from text/HTML content using custom patterns
- Validates URLs against business rules:
  - Skips data: and javascript: URLs
  - Handles file:// URLs and local paths
  - Resolves relative URLs against base URL
- Deduplicates extracted URLs while preserving order
- Converts local file paths to file:// URL format

#### URL Transformation Pipeline (Importance: 90)
- Creates directory structure mirroring URL paths
- Generates output paths based on URL structure:
  - Host becomes top-level directory
  - Path segments become subdirectories
  - Last segment becomes filename with .md extension
  - Default to index.md for root/empty paths

#### Retry Mechanism (Importance: 85)
- Implements exponential backoff for failed requests
- Handles transient network errors with multiple attempts
- Provides fallback strategies for content processing:
  1. Monolith-based HTML cleaning
  2. Simple HTML transformation if Monolith fails 
  3. Direct content extraction as last resort

#### HTML URL Discovery (Importance: 80)
- Extracts URLs from HTML attributes:
  - href, src, data-src
  - data-href, data-url  
  - srcset (handles multiple URLs)
- Fallback URL detection using LinkFinder
- Special handling for HTML content types

#### Concurrent URL Processing (Importance: 75)
- Dynamic concurrency based on CPU cores
- URL processing queue management
- Progress tracking for bulk operations
- Content reordering to match input sequence

File Paths:
- `src/url.rs`: URL extraction and transformation
- `src/html.rs`: HTML processing and URL discovery
- `src/lib.rs`: Concurrent processing coordination

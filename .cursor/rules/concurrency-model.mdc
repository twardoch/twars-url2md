# concurrency-model

The concurrency model implements an adaptive parallel processing system for URL handling:

### Core Concurrency Components
- Adaptive concurrency limit dynamically set to 2x available CPU cores
- URL processing queue with parallel execution
- Synchronized progress tracking across worker threads

### Key Implementation Details
`src/lib.rs`:
- Concurrent URL processor that spawns worker threads based on CPU core count
- Synchronized queue management distributes URLs across worker threads
- Progress tracking mechanism synchronized across threads for status reporting
- Retry mechanism with backoff for failed URL processing attempts

### Workload Distribution 
- URLs are processed in parallel across multiple threads
- Failed attempts are requeued with exponential backoff
- Results are collected and reordered to match original URL sequence

### Output Synchronization
- Pack mode aggregates markdown content from multiple threads
- Thread-safe progress bar updates
- Synchronized file writing when multiple threads complete URL processing

Importance Score: 85 - Critical for performance and reliability but not core business logic

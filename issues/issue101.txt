```
twars-url2md -h
```

Nothing is printed. The usage help should be printed. 

---

```
twars-url2md
```

prints

```
Error: Either --stdin or --input must be specified
Run with --help for usage information
```

Not much. Should be more extensive (basically same as `-h` output).

---

```
echo "https://helpx.adobe.com/pl/indesign/using/using-fonts.html" | twars-url2md --stdin
```

this prints 

```
2025-06-24T16:30:54.141096Z  INFO twars_url2md::cli: Reading URLs from stdin.
2025-06-24T16:30:54.142688Z  INFO twars_url2md: Collected 1 URLs to process.
2025-06-24T16:30:54.143531Z  INFO twars_url2md: Processing URL: https://helpx.adobe.com/pl/indesign/using/using-fonts.html
```

but then it stalls. It creates some subfolders (based on the domain URL structure) but that's it. 


```
echo "https://helpx.adobe.com/pl/indesign/using/using-fonts.html" | twars-url2md --stdin -p out.md
```

or 

```
echo "https://helpx.adobe.com/pl/indesign/using/using-fonts.html" | twars-url2md --stdin -o out
```

prints the `Processing URL:` etc. but then nothing gets written. 

Read `README.md` to understand how the app should work.

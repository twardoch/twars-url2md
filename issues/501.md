1. Analyze the entire project
2. Analyze @./llms.txt
3. Analyze @./CHANGELOG.md

Into @PLAN.md write:

- A plan to resolve the ambiguity between @./build.sh @./scripts/build.sh @./build.rs — maybe we need all of them, maybe not. Make sure that these scripts are uptodate and optimal. 
- A plan to update @./install.sh so that it’s optimal. 
- A plan to update @./README.md so that it’s uptodate. 
- A plan to resolve the following: 

```

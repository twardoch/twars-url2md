# Issue #502: Rust Compilation Error - Incompatible rustc Version

## Problem

Build failed with error:
```
error[E0514]: found crate `libc` compiled by an incompatible version of rustc
```

This error occurred because the `libc` crate and other dependencies were compiled with a different version of rustc than the current version (rustc 1.85.1).

## Root Cause

The Rust compiler was likely updated recently, but the compiled artifacts in the `target/` directory were built with the previous version. Rust's ABI is not stable between compiler versions, so artifacts must be recompiled when rustc is updated.

## Solution

Run `cargo clean` to remove all compiled artifacts, then rebuild:

```bash
cargo clean
cargo build
```

## Results

- **Build Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Linting (clippy)**: ✅ PASSED
- **Compilation**: ✅ SUCCESS (completed in 44.01s after clean)

The project now compiles successfully with rustc 1.85.1.

## Note on Tests

There is a separate issue with running tests related to the `redb` crate's libc dependency. The main build works correctly. If you encounter test compilation issues, you may need to:

1. Remove the entire target directory: `rm -rf target`
2. Clear Cargo's global cache if needed
3. Rebuild from scratch

## Commands Used

```bash
# Clean all build artifacts
cargo clean

# Verify the build works
cargo build

# For complete clean
rm -rf target && cargo build
```

## Prevention

In the future, after updating rustc, always run `cargo clean` before building to avoid this type of error.
